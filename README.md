# SSHFS-GUI

## A GUI wrapper for sshfs written in Rust and Slint-UI

[SSHFS](https://github.com/libfuse/sshfs) is a command line utility designed to mount file systems as network drives on a given computer. 

This project came to fruition because I got annoyed using nvim while editing server configuration files. SSHFS is a great utility, but remembering the command line arguments
is annoying.
